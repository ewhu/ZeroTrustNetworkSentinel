# ZeroTrustNetworkSentinel - Real-time Threat Detection and Response for Zero Trust Networks

ZeroTrustNetworkSentinel is a cutting-edge, open-source solution designed to detect and respond to threats in real-time, ensuring the integrity of zero trust networks.

Zero trust networks are built on the principle of default mistrust, where all traffic is treated as untrusted until verified. While this approach provides robust security, it also introduces complexity in monitoring and responding to threats. ZeroTrustNetworkSentinel addresses this challenge by providing a unified platform for threat detection, incident response, and security orchestration.

The ZeroTrustNetworkSentinel leverages advanced machine learning, network traffic analysis, and endpoint telemetry to identify potential threats. Upon detection, the system automates response actions, such as quarantining compromised endpoints, blocking malicious traffic, and alerting security teams. This real-time threat response capability enables organizations to minimize the attack surface and reduce the risk of data breaches.

The benefits of using ZeroTrustNetworkSentinel include:

* Enhanced threat detection and response capabilities
* Reduced mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR)
* Improved security orchestration and incident response
* Streamlined compliance with regulatory requirements
* Scalability and flexibility to accommodate growing networks

## Key Features

* **Real-time Threat Detection**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic, endpoint telemetry, and threat intelligence feeds to identify potential threats.
* **Automated Incident Response**: Orchestrates response actions, such as quarantine, blocking, and alerting, to minimize the attack surface and reduce the risk of data breaches.
* **Security Orchestration**: Provides a unified platform for security teams to monitor, respond, and remediate threats across the network.
* **Endpoint Telemetry**: Collects and analyzes endpoint data to identify compromised devices and respond accordingly.
* **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to accommodate growing networks, ensuring high performance and reliability.
* **Customizable Alerts and Notifications**: Configurable alerting system to notify security teams of potential threats and incidents.
* **Integration with Existing Security Tools**: Supports integration with popular security information and event management (SIEM) systems, incident response platforms, and threat intelligence feeds.

## Technology Stack

* **Python 3.9**: Primary programming language for the ZeroTrustNetworkSentinel platform.
* **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for threat detection and anomaly analysis.
* **Apache Kafka**: Distributed streaming platform for handling high-volume network traffic and telemetry data.
* **Elasticsearch**: Search and analytics engine for storing and querying threat intelligence feeds and incident response data.
* **Flask**: Micro web framework for building the web-based interface and API.

## Installation

1. Clone the ZeroTrustNetworkSentinel repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/ZeroTrustNetworkSentinel.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure the environment variables: `export KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:9092 && export ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=localhost:9200`
4. Start the Apache Kafka cluster: `kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties`
5. Initialize the Elasticsearch index: `curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/zerotrustsentinel' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'`
6. Run the ZeroTrustNetworkSentinel platform: `python app.py`

## Configuration

The following environment variables can be configured to customize the ZeroTrustNetworkSentinel platform:

* `KAFKA_BROKERS`: Comma-separated list of Kafka broker addresses
* `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST`: Elasticsearch host address
* `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT`: Elasticsearch port number
* `THREAT_INTELLIGENCE_FEEDS`: Comma-separated list of threat intelligence feed URLs

## Usage

The ZeroTrustNetworkSentinel platform provides a web-based interface for monitoring and responding to threats. The API documentation can be found at `/api/docs`.
